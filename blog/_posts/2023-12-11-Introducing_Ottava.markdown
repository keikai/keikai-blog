We are thrilled to share exciting news from our peer developers at Potix Corporation – the Official Launch of Ottava, our cutting-edge data management and analysis platform.

Over the past two years, our team has been diligently working on Ottava, inspired by the feedback and insights from our vibrant community, especially our '''Keikai Spreadsheet users'''. Recognizing the challenges faced by non-technical users in efficiently sharing spreadsheet templates and visualizing complex data, Ottava was conceived to address these pain points head-on.

## 2D vs Pivoted Data
One key observation during this process was the difficulty users faced when managing aggregated or pivoted spreadsheet templates. Often, users found themselves needing to convert their data into a 2D tabular format before utilizing analytic tools. This cumbersome process typically involved using data preparation tools, power queries, or other workarounds.

## Why Ottava
Ottava empowers you to intuitively input and analyze aggregated or pivoted tables, such as sales reports, monthly budgets, income statements, and more. No longer do you need to reshape your data to fit analytic tools; Ottava seamlessly handles it for you. What's more, our patented technology intelligently recommends the most suitable charts, enhancing your data comprehension and supporting informed decision-making.
