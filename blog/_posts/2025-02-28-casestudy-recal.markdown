## Keikai x ReCAL

ReCAL (Responsible Credit and Lending) is a Lending-as-a-Service (LaaS) platform leveraging enterprise-grade IT architecture and microservices for secure, scalable lending operations. A key component of its system is the Keikai Spreadsheet framework, which enables low-code business logic, allowing credit evaluation teams to modify scoring models without engineering expertise. 

By embedding Keikai, ReCAL streamlines loan processing, automates data ingestion, and accelerates new product deployment using structured XLSX templates. Unlike SaaS alternatives, Keikai’s on-premise deployment ensures compliance, data privacy, and real-time performance. This integration enhances ReCAL’s agility, making data-driven lending more efficient and responsive in a competitive financial landscape.


### "Keikai allows for ReCal's credit evaluation and risk assessment team to change the score card without having to have software engineering knowledge"

### "Keikai's on-premise deployment overcomes the compliance challenges associated with web-based SaaS platforms like Google Sheets."

### "With its modular architecture and extensive library of pre-built components, KeiKai enables developers to create responsive and scalable web solutions efficiently."
