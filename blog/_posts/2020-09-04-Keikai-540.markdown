Dear all, 

Keikai Spreadsheet is a modern & fast ajax web spreadsheet component that brings Excel functionalities into your web application. 

Keikai 5.4.0 will come with more than 30 enhancements. We have replaced the formula parser meaning it is now compatible with a wider range of Excel files and settings. In addition the parsing speed is 100% faster when parsing complicated strings. 
Filtering performance has also been optimized, trimming the filtering time down from 15 seconds to 1 second against a large sheet containing tens of thousands of rows and hundreds of columns.


Other highlighted features & improvements include: 

* [KEIKAI-294] (https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/KEIKAI-294) - sparklines can resize according to column width and row height
* [KEIKAI-301] (https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/KEIKAI-301) - provide an option to move the selection to a different direction after pressing enter key
* [KEIKAI-302] (https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/KEIKAI-302) - show zero values as blank cell
* [KEIKAI-311] (https://tracker.zkoss.org/browse/KEIKAI-311) - support sparklines color for importing and exporting


We hope you find these enhancements and performance boosts useful to your project.
